## Clustered Cellular Automata Simulator 

This is a program I wrote for a research seminar class. It runs on any number of computers and load balances itself in order to not waste time.  
A lot more information can be found in the `classwork` folder, I wrote a paper on it. Additionally in the classwork folder there is a rendered video of a simulation taking place over 6 computers (The green bars represent the border between what two computers are simulating).
